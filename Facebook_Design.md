### 1. Visual hierarchy - What areas are denser and what areas are more sparse?



### 2. Who is the most likely user of this page?

### 4. Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?


### 5. Do the relationships between elements lead you to that goal?



### 6. What font families are most prominent on the page?



### 7. What do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?



### 8. How do the line spacings, sizes and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?



### 9. What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?
